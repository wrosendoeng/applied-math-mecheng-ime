# Applied Mathematics for Mechanical Engineering

Creating a repository to demonstrate Fourier Analysis using Fortran
1. Create a function to calculate f(x)
2. Comparing f(x) with a0/2 + sum(an*cos(n*pi*x/L) + bn*sin(n*pi*x/L))
3. Plotting charts with Gnuplot using "execute_command_line" in Fortran
